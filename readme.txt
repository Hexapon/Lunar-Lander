I, Logan Yokum, and Katie Liebscher worked on this project as a pair. We are in Section 1 of Fundamentals of Computing.

We created a clone of the classic game Lunar Lander. In our game, you use the arrow keys to fly the ship. In order to beat the game, you must land on one of the designated landing zones under a certain speed. If you try to land on a surface that is not a landing zone or land at too great a speed, then you will lose the game. Have fun!
